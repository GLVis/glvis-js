# Web version of GLVis

The _index.html_ page in this directory contains a fully-featured web version of GLVis, also available at
https://glvis.org/live. This web version enables GLVis capabilities on any machine with a modern browser, and
is also fully supported on mobile touch devices, such as tablets and phones.

## Interaction and help

The web version of GLVis support virtually all features of the desktop client, including key commands, mouse interactions, socket connections, and adds touch support for mobile devices.

Additional functionality is available via several buttons that appear when hovering at the top of the screen. These buttons are (from top left to top right):

- `Load local file`
- `Connect to socket`
- `Help`
- `Examples`
- `Visualization controls`
- `Fullscreen mode`

In addition to the `Help` button, help is accessible via the `h` key.

## Loading local and external files

The web version of GLVis can be used to load local files in the [`glvis*.saved` format](https://glvis.org/options-and-use/#server-mode),
which can be generated by the `-save` option of the desktop version. See the `Load local file` button in
the upper left of the _index.html_ page and https://glvis.org/live. This is analogous to the `-saved` option
of the desktop version and can be used as an for `./glvis –m mesh –g gf`.

The web version of GLVis can also load local or remote streams by directly parsing the `stream` HTML argument
in the format: `<site>/live?stream=<url>`, which can be used for hosting and presenting simulation data on the web.

For example, https://glvis.org/live?stream=https://glvis.org/data/streams/ex9.saved will fetch _ex9.saved_
from glvis.org and render it instead of the normal _quad.saved_ on startup. The same can be done with
data from an external site or if you're hosting locally after running [`make serve`](../README.md#serving-to-a-device-on-your-local-network): https://localhost:8000/live?stream=https://glvis.org/data/streams/ex9.saved.

## Loading streams from MFEM

Just like the desktop version, the web version of GLVis can also be used to view MFEM visualization streams
via the `../glvis-browser-server` script, which forwards MFEM streams to the _index.html_ page or
https://glvis.org/live using websockets.
This can be used as an alternative to running a local server with `./glvis`,

The connection is established in the `Connect to socket` button of the web version (in the upper left), which has controls for connecting to and disconnecting from a `glvis-browser-server`. To pause/resume a stream (e.g. in from a time-dependent MFEM simulation) press `space` or double-tap on mobile. The speed of the animation can be adjusted with a slider under `Visualization controls` / `Animation`. Socket connection can also be established from mobile devices when the web version is run locally with [`make serve`](../README.md#serving-to-a-device-on-your-local-network).

Example usages:

1. `cd glvis-js && ./glvis-browser-server`

   - Requires Python 3.6.1+ and [`websockets`](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) (installable with `pip`).
   - Assumes default MFEM port of `19916`.

2. Visit https://glvis.org/live or open `glvis-js/live` in a browser

3. Open the `Setup` menu and click the `Connect to socket` button

   - Default host and websocket port are `localhost:8080`.
   - You can also use `{hostname}:8080` if you are connecting from another device on your network.
   - Press `space` (or double-tap on mobile) to pause the stream or, in the case that a pause message was sent, resume the stream.
   - Does not currently work in Safari from https://glvis.org/live (seems to require a secure websocket).

4. `cd mfem/examples && ./ex9` in a separate terminal

5. `Ctrl-c` to stop `glvis-browser-server`

## Examples and visualization controls

A number of pre-defined example streams are included in the https://glvis.org/live page. See the `Examples` button in the upper right. These include the results of several MFEM examples and miniapps which are also linked from their corresponding images at https://mfem.org/examples.

Next to `Examples` is the `Visualization controls` button that provides a touch-friendly interface to some of the most used GLVis key commands. Note the `Redraw` button at the bottom of the `Visualization controls` list, which can be useful to redraw the visualization scene.

## Fullscreen mode

In the upper right corner of the web version there is a button for expanding to fullscreen.
Follow your browsers instructions, press the fullscreen button, or use the `esc` key to exit.

Note: Fullscreen mode does not currently work in Safari.
